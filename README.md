# Proverb [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnnyreilly/proverb)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/proverb)
=========

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.
